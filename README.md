[Design & Demonstration Video](https://streamable.com/5qicx)


This is a telescoping fidget-toy/Christmas ornament for those that want a little more of that Aphex Acid on their tree this year.

It lays/hangs flat on the tree but when tilted back telescopes out over six times its original depth for that stunning collapsed look.

This design is very much inspired by the amazing T69 Collapse music video released earlier this year. I loved the look of the AFX-ified Gwennap Pit and wanted a physical version to play with and this satisfies that need to a T. Since it's around Christmas time, I decided to make it the proper size to hang on a tree too with a built-in channel to you can tie it up with fancy ribbon or thread.

The design is free to download and print to your heart's content, so print a bunch and give them away to your AFX-fan friends for last minute gifts!

Special thanks go to reddit user /u/energyface for his vector trace of the collapse logo and to /u/afxfan for planting the idea in my head.
